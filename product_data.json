No Bluetooth support. Only wifi 2.4ghz is supported, no 5ghz wifi support. PICTURE & AUDIO quality is SUPERB. Supports dolby and hdr.\nBuy this Only if u want reliability (samsung displays are very reliable and last long unlike cheap counterparts) , good picture and audio quality.\n\nBought the bezel less 2022 variant for 14,990 rupees.\nSamsung is a reliable brand. Picture & quality is good. Although it's not a full hd 1080p display, at 32 inches its not apparent.\n\nUser interface is okay. Netflix app works smooth but prime video app is laggy. Tizen os is fine. So no google play store. Doesn't support chromecast, only supports Mira cast which is a different casting protocol.\n\nFeature wise tizen os is bare minimum. But you can easily buy an android tv box to get google play functionality if u want to run android apps.\n\nBrands like tcl, ifalconn, redmi offer more features because they run google tv\\ android tv but their hardware is not reliable.\n\nThis samsung 32inches tv is great deal if u buy at 14k inr. Great picture clarity. Good sound quality. HDR works good. Samsung has great after sales customer service. So if u want good quality and reliable TV and don't care too much about having android tv os, go for this. It's a great product.\n\nRead more\n213 people found this helpful\nHelpful\nReport\nSee more reviews",
